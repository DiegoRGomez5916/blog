                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While working on a school project I came across the Max Flow algorithm. This algorithm takes a graph data structure that represents a network that has a capacity 
                along each edge and finds the configuration of the graph that maximizes the flow of the whole graph by pushing flow along the graph. This algorithm has 
                many applications such as pipe network simulations, circuits, and wireless communications. The basis of this algorithm is a concept called augmenting paths and 
                finding these augmenting paths is the condition that determines if the max flow has been reached or not.<a href="blog_posts/max_flow_algorithm_post.html">Read more...</a>
